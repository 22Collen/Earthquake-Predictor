AI SOLUTION:
The solution is relevant to the theme because the area of Welkom experience earthquakes the most. Therefore, we have developed an AI model which will aim to predict the occurrence of future earthquakes by analyzing historical datasets, weather patterns and environmental conditions. The Earthquake predictor will be the best solution as it will give authorities and communities critical time to implement evacuation plans, secure infrastructure and initiative emergencyÂ measures.

OBJECTIVE OF THE BUSINESS: 
The main business goal of deploying AI Earthquake Predictor in Welkom is to Enhance the 
effectiveness, responsiveness, and efficiency of earthquake preparedness, response, and recovery 
efforts. To decrease the loss of lives, property, and resources in Welkom, utilizing AI technology 
is needed to better predict, monitor, and mitigate the impact of earthquake disaster. 
 
CRITERIA FOR BUSINESS SUCCESS: 
1. Accuracy and Reliability: AI Earthquake Predictor should offer precise and trustworthy 
forecasts and insights to support decision-making during earthquake disaster occurrences. 
2. Speed and Responsiveness: The Earthquake Predictor should be quick to react to changing 
circumstances and new dangers in order to make timely interventions. 
3. Facilitating Stakeholder Collaboration: The Earthquake Predictor should promote interaction 
and cooperation with stakeholders of the Welkom community.
4. Lessened Impact: The use of AI Earthquake Predictor should lessen the number of people 
killed, the amount of property damaged, and the overall impact of disasters. 
5. Long-term Planning: By evaluating past data and spotting trends, AI Earthquake Predictor can 
be utilized for long-term planning, improving calamity preparedness plans.

BUSINESS BACKGROUND: 
The purpose of us creating this AI Earthquake Predictor is to address the rising frequency and 
severity of earthquake disasters in Welkom. The complexity and size of modern Earthquake 
disasters are frequently beyond the capabilities of traditional disaster management techniques. 
Through the use of data-driven insights, predictive modeling, and real-time decision assistance, 
AI Earthquake Predictor has the ability to completely transform these procedures.
